# PythonNLP

Final year project for my engineering degree in mathematical engineering and computer science with BNP Paribas. 

This project this project aims to compare different methods for French text classification, including that involving neural networks. 

You can find there three models. 
The first one involving Bayesian methods, the second a convolutional neural network CNN and the third a long short term memory neural network LSTM. 

## Prerequisites

You need to install few python libraries for set up neural networks. 

See the requirement.txt file and launch the following command : 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Most of models are inspired by the Keras team, you can see their git bellow : https://github.com/keras-team/keras/tree/master/examples


## Organization 

### Extract folder 

All data are based on chats talks and telephone survey. 
Here you can find some scripts for extract and "labelize" the data. 

I obviously not use personal data from clients, only verbatim data without link with clients personal accounts. 


### Models folder

Here you can find three folders, one for each models.
